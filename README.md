# computing club website

Website for computing club
The main page as of now remains purposely simple

The site is served with expressjs for simplicity and maintainabilty

## Contributing: 
Full guide coming soon, in the meantime:
- Please use proper conventions and stuff
- Shoot a dm on discord if we don't get to your pr within the day

It is a rule that pages must be plain html, or be extremely complex, and beautiful. Seeing as we are a computing club, a run of the mill, standard web page is not acceptable. 
The use of express allows for easy proxying to other origins should it be required
